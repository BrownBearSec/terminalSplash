# terminalSplash

A silly project to give me a golang refresher and to make someone smile every now and then

## What is it?

A small program which prints out a random line of quote or phrase whenever you open a terminal.
Add or remove quotes by editing the `splashText.txt` file found in this directory

## Installation

`cd /opt`
`git clone `
`cd terminalSplash`
`chmod +x install.sh`
